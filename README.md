# SFDX  App

## About
Welcome! This Repo is the code base for RAD Women Part I, a ten-week course that introduces the basics of coding on the Salesforce Platform.  It contains class files with demonstration code, class exercises and homework that complements the other curriculum materials.  This code is dependent on the data model distributed with the RAD Women managed package.  If you don't have access to that package or need to install an updated version, you can reach us at apexradwomen@gmail.com

We welcome contributions from anyone familiar with the course and proficient in Apex who would like to contribute.  We ask that you have experience with the curriculum, as it is important to understand which concepts have been introduced week-by-week, so that we have samples and examples that are accesssible to learners.  If that sounds like you, please feel free to fork and make a pull request!

## Resources
You can reach us at apexradwomen@gmail.com and on our website http://radwomen.org/

## Description of Files and Directories
Please note that this code base is in SFDX Format.  You can submit pull requests with updates to existing files, where appropriate, or new files.  If you're not sure, we recommend creating new files for your sample code, and we may choose to pull from those files and integrate with existing files and exercises.  

## Top Needs
While we welcome bug reports and refinements in all areas, we are particularly interested in:
1. Sample Trigger/Trigger Handler patterns (Beginner Friendly!)
2. Practice exercises for challenging concepts (Maps, Loops, Bulk Patterns, Object-Oriented Code)
3. Improvements to sample code and exercises to make them more realistic for a typical Salesforce implementation and/or to update older patterns into currently accepted best practices.
